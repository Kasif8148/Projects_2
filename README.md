SECURITY ALARM SYSTEM BASED ON PIR SENSOR 

Under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Rakesh Kumar Jha 

Designed and implemented a highly efficient security alarm system using PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors.

Ensuring real-time detection of human presence and enhancing overall security measures.

Enabling the system to distinguish between normal environmental changes, minimizing false alarms, and improving the system.

Tools: Arduino UNO, PIR sensor, UM3561 IC, Speaker, transistor
